# Chapter 15: Relativity from Modular Time

## 15.1 The Intuitive Picture: Absolute Time and Newtonian Gravity

The intuitive picture is the Newtonian one:

- Time is universal and flows the same everywhere.
- Space is a three-dimensional stage.
- Gravity is a force acting at a distance.

This picture is simple and matches everyday experience. When you and your friend synchronize watches, they stay synchronized. When you walk across a room, the room doesn't change shape. When an apple falls, it's being pulled by the Earth.

Newton made this precise. In his *Principia* of 1687, he wrote: "Absolute, true, and mathematical time, of itself, and from its own nature, flows equably without relation to anything external."

Space was similarly absolute. A container that exists whether or not anything is in it. Objects move through space; space itself is fixed and unchanging.

This worldview worked spectacularly well for two centuries. It predicted planetary orbits, tides, the motion of comets. It launched the Industrial Revolution and put humans on the Moon.

And yet, it's wrong.

## 15.2 The Surprising Hint: Light Refuses to Behave

### Maxwell's Equations

In the 1860s, James Clerk Maxwell unified electricity and magnetism into a single theory. His equations predicted electromagnetic waves traveling at a specific speed:

$$c = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\epsilon_0 \mu_0}} \approx 3 \times 10^8 \text{ m/s}$$

This was the speed of light. Maxwell had discovered that light is an electromagnetic wave.

But there was a puzzle. Speed relative to what?

### The Aether Hypothesis

Physicists assumed light must propagate through a medium, just as sound propagates through air. They called this medium the "luminiferous aether." It filled all space and provided the reference frame in which Maxwell's equations held.

If the aether exists, the Earth should be moving through it. As the Earth orbits the Sun at 30 km/s, we should be able to detect an "aether wind." Light traveling into the wind should be slower than light traveling with it.

### The Michelson-Morley Experiment

In 1887, Albert Michelson and Edward Morley built the most sensitive optical instrument of its time. They split a light beam in two, sent the halves in perpendicular directions, reflected them back, and recombined them.

If the aether existed, light traveling parallel to Earth's motion would take a different time than light traveling perpendicular. The recombined beams would be out of phase. Interference fringes would shift as the apparatus rotated.

They found nothing. No shift. No aether wind.

The experiment was repeated with increasing precision for decades. The result never changed. The speed of light is the same in all directions. There is no aether.

### The Crisis

This was deeply problematic. Maxwell's equations predicted a specific speed for light. But speed relative to what, if not the aether?

Lorentz and FitzGerald proposed that objects physically contract in the direction of motion, exactly canceling the expected time difference. This "length contraction" hypothesis saved the appearances but seemed ad hoc.

The crisis demanded resolution. It came from a patent clerk in Bern.

## 15.3 Einstein's Revolution

### The Two Postulates

In 1905, Albert Einstein published "On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies." He cut through the confusion with two simple postulates:

1. **The Principle of Relativity**: The laws of physics are the same in all inertial frames.
2. **The Constancy of Light Speed**: Light travels at speed c in vacuum, regardless of the motion of the source or observer.

The second postulate sounds impossible. If you're on a train moving at 100 km/h and throw a ball forward at 50 km/h, a stationary observer sees the ball moving at 150 km/h. Velocities add.

But light doesn't work that way. If you're on the train and shine a flashlight forward, both you and the stationary observer measure the light traveling at exactly c. Not c + 100 km/h. Just c.

### Time Must Give Way

Einstein realized that if the speed of light is constant for all observers, something else must change. That something is time itself.

Consider two events: a flash of light is emitted, and it hits a detector. The time between these events depends on the observer.

For an observer at rest relative to the apparatus, light travels a short distance. The time interval is t.

For an observer moving relative to the apparatus, the light travels a longer path (following the moving detector). But light speed is the same. So the time interval must be longer: t' > t.

Moving clocks run slow.

### The Lorentz Factor

The mathematics falls out elegantly. Define:

$$\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$$

This is the Lorentz factor. For everyday speeds, gamma is essentially 1. For v = 0.9c, gamma = 2.3. As v approaches c, gamma goes to infinity.

Time dilation:

$$\Delta t' = \gamma \Delta t$$

A moving clock ticks slower by the factor gamma.

Length contraction:

$$L' = \frac{L}{\gamma}$$

A moving object is contracted in the direction of motion by the factor gamma.

### The Relativity of Simultaneity

The deepest consequence is subtler. Events that are simultaneous in one frame are not simultaneous in another.

If a train car is struck by lightning at both ends simultaneously (in the train frame), a stationary observer sees the front strike first. If the strikes are simultaneous for the stationary observer, the train passenger sees the rear strike first.

There is no absolute "now." Simultaneity is relative.

## 15.4 Spacetime: The New Geometry

### Minkowski's Insight

In 1908, Hermann Minkowski, Einstein's former mathematics professor, recast special relativity as geometry. At a lecture in Cologne, he declared:

"Henceforth space by itself, and time by itself, are doomed to fade away into mere shadows, and only a kind of union of the two will preserve an independent reality."

Space and time are not separate. They are aspects of a single entity: spacetime.

### The Spacetime Interval

In ordinary geometry, the distance between two points is:

$$ds^2 = dx^2 + dy^2 + dz^2$$

This is invariant under rotations. Different observers who rotate their axes will disagree about x, y, and z individually, but they'll agree on ds.

In spacetime, the invariant quantity is:

$$ds^2 = -c^2 dt^2 + dx^2 + dy^2 + dz^2$$

Note the minus sign. Time enters with the opposite sign from space. This is Lorentzian geometry, not Euclidean.

Different observers disagree about t and x individually. But they all agree on ds. The spacetime interval is the fundamental invariant.

### The Light Cone

When ds^2 = 0, we have:

$$c^2 dt^2 = dx^2 + dy^2 + dz^2$$

This describes light rays. Light travels on the boundary of the light cone.

Events with ds^2 < 0 (more time separation than space separation) are "timelike separated." A massive particle can travel between them.

Events with ds^2 > 0 (more space separation than time separation) are "spacelike separated." Nothing can travel between them. They are causally disconnected.

The light cone is the same for all observers. This is why causality is preserved even when simultaneity is not.

## 15.5 Evidence for Special Relativity

Special relativity is not speculative. It's one of the most precisely tested theories in physics.

### Muon Decay

Muons are unstable particles created when cosmic rays hit the atmosphere. Their half-life is 2.2 microseconds. Traveling at nearly light speed, they should decay long before reaching the ground.

But they don't. Time dilation stretches their lifetime. From our perspective, the muons' clocks run slow, so they live long enough to reach detectors at sea level.

From the muons' perspective, length contraction shrinks the atmosphere. They don't live longer; they just have less distance to travel.

Both perspectives are consistent. Both give the same answer. Muons reach the ground.

### Particle Accelerators

At the Large Hadron Collider, protons are accelerated to 0.999999991c. Their Lorentz factor is about 7,500. Their mass energy is increased by the same factor.

If special relativity were wrong, the accelerator wouldn't work. The particles would behave differently than predicted. They don't. Special relativity is confirmed every second the LHC operates.

### GPS Satellites

The Global Positioning System requires timing accuracy of nanoseconds. GPS satellites orbit at high speed (time dilation makes their clocks run slow) and at high altitude (gravitational time dilation, which we'll discuss shortly, makes their clocks run fast).

Without relativistic corrections, GPS would accumulate errors of 10 kilometers per day. It works because the corrections are applied. Every time you use GPS, you're confirming Einstein.

## 15.6 General Relativity: Gravity as Geometry

Special relativity describes uniform motion. But what about acceleration? What about gravity?

### The Equivalence Principle

Einstein's key insight came from a simple observation. In a falling elevator, you float weightless. You can't tell the difference between falling in a gravitational field and floating in empty space.

Conversely, standing on Earth feels exactly like accelerating upward at 9.8 m/s^2. You can't tell the difference.

This is the **Equivalence Principle**: gravity and acceleration are locally indistinguishable.

Einstein called this "the happiest thought of my life."

### The Elevator Thought Experiment

Imagine you're in a windowless elevator. It could be sitting on Earth, or it could be accelerating upward in empty space. How would you tell the difference?

You drop a ball. It falls. Is it being pulled by gravity, or is the floor accelerating up to meet it?

You can't tell. The two situations are physically equivalent.

Now imagine a beam of light crosses the elevator horizontally. If the elevator is accelerating upward, the light's path curves downward relative to the floor. The light "falls."

By the equivalence principle, light must also bend in a gravitational field. Gravity affects light.

### Curved Spacetime

But wait. Light travels in straight lines. If light bends near massive objects, maybe "straight" isn't what we think.

Einstein's radical proposal: massive objects curve spacetime itself. Light still travels along the straightest possible paths. But in curved spacetime, the straightest paths are curves.

A geodesic is the straightest path in a curved geometry. On a sphere, geodesics are great circles. On Earth, the shortest flight from New York to London curves north over the Atlantic.

In curved spacetime, planets don't orbit the Sun because of a force. They're following geodesics in the curved geometry created by the Sun's mass. They're going as straight as they can, but the space around them is bent.

### The Einstein Field Equations

Einstein spent years developing the mathematics. The result, published in 1915:

$$G_{\mu\nu} + \Lambda g_{\mu\nu} = \frac{8\pi G}{c^4} T_{\mu\nu}$$

On the left: the Einstein tensor G, which describes the curvature of spacetime, plus a cosmological constant term.

On the right: the stress-energy tensor T, which describes the distribution of matter and energy.

John Wheeler summarized it: "Spacetime tells matter how to move; matter tells spacetime how to curve."

### Gravitational Time Dilation

Clocks run slower in stronger gravitational fields. This is gravitational time dilation.

At sea level, clocks tick slightly slower than at mountain tops. The effect is tiny but measurable. GPS satellites must correct for it.

Near a black hole, the effect is extreme. From far away, a clock falling toward the event horizon appears to slow down and freeze. The clock never seems to cross the horizon.

From the clock's perspective, nothing special happens at the horizon. It falls right through. But signals it sends take longer and longer to escape, until they can't escape at all.

## 15.7 Evidence for General Relativity

### The Precession of Mercury

Mercury's orbit precesses: its closest approach to the Sun slowly rotates around the Sun. Newton's theory couldn't fully explain this. There was a discrepancy of 43 arcseconds per century.

Einstein's equations predicted exactly this amount. It was the first confirmation of general relativity.

### Light Bending

Einstein predicted that starlight passing near the Sun would be deflected by 1.75 arcseconds. In 1919, Arthur Eddington photographed stars during a solar eclipse. The stars near the Sun appeared displaced.

The measurement confirmed Einstein's prediction. Headlines proclaimed: "Revolution in Science. New Theory of the Universe. Newton's Ideas Overthrown."

### Gravitational Waves

In 2015, the LIGO detectors observed gravitational waves for the first time. Two black holes, each about 30 solar masses, spiraled together and merged. The resulting gravitational waves stretched and compressed space itself.

The signal matched Einstein's predictions perfectly. A century after he wrote down the equations, ripples in spacetime were finally detected.

### Black Holes

General relativity predicts that sufficient mass concentrated in a small enough region creates a black hole: a region from which nothing, not even light, can escape.

In 2019, the Event Horizon Telescope photographed the shadow of the black hole at the center of galaxy M87. In 2022, they imaged Sagittarius A*, the black hole at the center of our own galaxy.

Black holes exist. Einstein's geometry is correct.

## 15.8 Recovering Special Relativity from the Screen

Now we connect to our model.

### Time as Modular Flow

In previous chapters, we developed the idea that time emerges from modular flow. Each observer has a patch P on the holographic screen. The reduced density matrix on that patch defines a modular Hamiltonian:

$$K_P = -\ln \rho_P$$

This Hamiltonian generates a flow:

$$\sigma_t(A) = e^{iKt} A e^{-iKt}$$

This modular flow is what the observer experiences as time.

### Geometric Modular Flow on Caps

Consider a cap C on the sphere S^2. In our model, under the right conditions, modular flow becomes geometric.

The conditions are:
- Markov structure in the collar around the cap boundary (Assumption F)
- MaxEnt selection with rotationally invariant constraints (Assumptions B-C)
- Euclidean regularity (Assumption G)
- Modular covariance on the cap net (Assumption H)

When these hold, the modular Hamiltonian is proportional to the geometric generator of cap-preserving conformal dilations:

$$K_C = 2\pi B_C$$

This is the Bisognano-Wichmann result adapted to the sphere.

### Conformal Symmetry Is Lorentz Symmetry

Here's the key insight. The group of orientation-preserving conformal transformations of S^2 is:

$$\text{Conf}^+(S^2) \cong PSL(2, \mathbb{C}) \cong SO^+(3,1)$$

The conformal group of the sphere is isomorphic to the Lorentz group.

Moebius transformations of the complex plane (which is the Riemann sphere S^2) are exactly Lorentz transformations of the celestial sphere that a relativistic observer sees.

Lorentz kinematics is not assumed. It emerges from the requirement that modular clocks on overlapping patches must be compatible.

### Why There Is No Privileged Reference Frame

This deserves careful explanation, because it addresses a natural worry about our model.

If reality is a quantum system on a 2D sphere, with qubits arranged on a fixed lattice, why isn't there a "God's eye view" of the whole sphere? Wouldn't that be a privileged reference frame?

The answer is that **there is no observer outside the sphere**. The model does not include any external vantage point. Observers are not users viewing a simulation. They are patterns *within* the qubit data itself.

Think about what an observer actually is in this model. An observer is a stable correlation pattern among some subset of the screen degrees of freedom. This pattern has access only to its patch $P_O \subset S^2$. No observer can access the entire sphere simultaneously. The "global state" $\omega$ exists mathematically, but no entity within the model can observe it.

Now consider two observers with overlapping patches. Each has their own modular flow (their own clock). When we ask "how do their descriptions relate?", we need transformations that:

1. Map patches to patches on the sphere
2. Preserve the consistency structure (overlaps must still agree)
3. Do not single out any particular patch as special

The group of such transformations is the conformal group of $S^2$. This is a mathematical fact about the sphere's geometry. And Conf$(S^2) \cong$ SO(3,1) is the Lorentz group.

So Lorentz invariance is not imposed from outside. It is the *only* way different observer perspectives can be consistently related without privileging any one of them.

**The qubits do not need to move.** What we call "motion" in the emergent 4D spacetime is not qubits rearranging themselves. Motion is a pattern in how correlations change. A "moving particle" is a correlation pattern that shifts across the screen. A "Lorentz boost" is a transformation relating how two observers describe the same correlation pattern.

The substrate (the qubits) is not in spacetime. Spacetime emerges from how patches relate to each other. Asking "what frame are the qubits in?" is like asking "what color is the number seven?" The question assumes a category error.

### Why the Speed of Light Is Universal

Why is there a maximum speed, and why is it the same for everyone?

In our model, information propagates on the screen. The modular flow determines the rate of propagation. The conformal structure of S^2 determines the causal structure.

The speed of light c is the conversion factor between modular time and geometric distance. It's universal because the conformal structure of the sphere is unique.

Different observers have different modular flows. But their flows are all conformal transformations of S^2. The Lorentz group is precisely the set of transformations that preserve the causal structure while changing the observer's notion of time.

## 15.9 Recovering General Relativity

Special relativity emerges from the conformal structure of the screen. What about gravity?

### What Patch Consistency Does (and Doesn't) Give Us

Let's be precise about what comes from where. The derivation of Einstein's equations uses several ingredients, and patch consistency is only one of them.

**What patch consistency contributes directly:**
- No privileged observer → no preferred frame
- Lorentz kinematics from Conf(S²) ≅ SO(3,1)
- The promotion of a scalar equation to a tensor equation (see below)

**What requires additional assumptions:**
- MaxEnt state selection
- The connection between modular flow and stress-energy (the "EFT bridge")
- The thermodynamic/entanglement equilibrium insight itself

### Jacobson's Insight (1995, 2016)

The core idea predates our framework. In 1995, Ted Jacobson showed that Einstein's equations can be derived from thermodynamics. The key ingredients are:

1. Entropy is proportional to horizon area
2. Heat is energy flux across a horizon
3. Temperature is proportional to surface gravity

Demanding the first law of thermodynamics hold for all local horizons yields Einstein's equation. This is a general result that works in many contexts; it doesn't require our specific observer-patch setup.

### What Our Framework Adds

Our framework provides a *reason* for entanglement equilibrium and connects it to patch consistency:

**MaxEnt selection (Assumption B):** The global state maximizes entropy subject to overlap consistency constraints. This is an additional assumption about how nature selects states; it's not forced by patch consistency alone.

**Entanglement equilibrium from MaxEnt:** If the state maximizes entropy subject to constraints, then for variations preserving those constraints:

$$\delta S_{\text{gen}}(C) = 0$$

This is why entropy is stationary: not because of a separate thermodynamic postulate, but because of MaxEnt selection.

**The first law:** For a small cap C with generalized entropy:

$$S_{\text{gen}}(C) = \frac{\langle A \rangle}{4G} + S_{\text{bulk}}(C)$$

The first law relates entropy variation to modular energy:

$$\delta S_C = \delta \langle K_C \rangle$$

With geometric modular flow (K_C = 2π B_C), this becomes:

$$\delta S_C = 2\pi \delta \langle B_C \rangle$$

### The Stress Tensor Bridge (Not Yet Derived)

To get Einstein's equation, we need to connect modular energy to the stress tensor. This is where our framework still has a gap. There are two routes:

**Route 1: UV CFT regime.** If the physics on small caps is described by a conformal field theory, the modular Hamiltonian is explicitly local:

$$K = \int_\Sigma T_{ab} \zeta^b d\Sigma^a$$

where ζ is the conformal Killing field preserving the diamond.

**Route 2: Null-surface modular bridge.** Even without assuming a CFT, we can construct a stress tensor from modular data on null surfaces. Modular additivity plus half-sided inclusion yields a local density T_{kk} for each null direction k. This determines a symmetric tensor T_{ab}.

Neither route is derived from our core axioms A1-A4. This is listed as an open gap in the technical paper.

### The Einstein Equation

Combining the entropy variation with the geometric identity for area variation at fixed volume:

$$\delta A\big|_{V} = -\frac{\Omega_{d-2} \ell^d}{d^2-1}(G_{00} + \Lambda g_{00})$$

the equilibrium condition yields:

$$G_{00} + \Lambda g_{00} = 8\pi G \langle T_{00} \rangle$$

This holds in the rest frame of each small cap.

### Where Patch Consistency Actually Enters

Here's the distinctive contribution of our framework: Different observers through the same bulk point have different rest frames. The equilibrium argument gives Einstein's equation in each observer's rest frame separately.

**Patch consistency forces these to be compatible.** If observer A gets $G_{00}^{(A)} = 8\pi G T_{00}^{(A)}$ and observer B gets $G_{00}^{(B)} = 8\pi G T_{00}^{(B)}$, and they must agree on the overlapping physics, then the equation must hold as a tensor equation in all frames:

$$G_{ab} + \Lambda g_{ab} = 8\pi G \langle T_{ab} \rangle$$

So patch consistency promotes the scalar relation to a tensor equation. But the scalar relation itself comes from MaxEnt + the EFT bridge, not from patch consistency.

### Honest Summary

The derivation chain is:

```
MaxEnt (Assumption B)
    → δS_gen = 0 (entanglement equilibrium)
    → [EFT bridge needed here]
    → G_00 = 8πG T_00 in each rest frame
    → Patch consistency promotes to tensor equation
    → G_ab = 8πG T_ab
```

Patch consistency plays a role, but it's not the main engine. The main engine is MaxEnt + Jacobson's thermodynamic insight. Our framework's contribution is providing a *reason* for MaxEnt (it's how nature selects among overlap-consistent states) and using patch consistency to get the full tensor equation.

### Classical Mechanics from Emergent GR

Once the Einstein equation is established, classical mechanics follows automatically.

**Conservation laws.** The contracted Bianchi identity is geometric: $\nabla^a G_{ab} = 0$. Combined with the Einstein equation, this implies stress-energy conservation: $\nabla^a T_{ab} = 0$. Energy and momentum are conserved not because we postulate them, but because the geometry demands it.

**Geodesic motion.** For pressureless matter ("dust"), $T^{ab} = \rho u^a u^b$. Conservation gives $\nabla_a(\rho u^a u^b) = 0$. Working this out yields the geodesic equation: $u^a \nabla_a u^b = 0$. Free particles follow the straightest paths through curved spacetime. This is not an additional postulate. It follows from the Einstein equation.

**Newton's laws.** In the weak-field, slow-motion limit, the Einstein equation reduces to Newton's gravitational law: $\nabla^2 \Phi = 4\pi G \rho$. Geodesic motion becomes $\ddot{\mathbf{x}} = -\nabla \Phi$. This is Newton's second law with gravitational force.

So classical mechanics is a derived consequence. The familiar laws of motion and gravity emerge from the deeper framework when we consider the appropriate limit. Newton's physics remains valid in its domain, but it is no longer fundamental.

## 15.10 Why Emergent Gravity Still Works

If spacetime geometry emerges from information theory, why does general relativity work so well?

### The Hydrodynamic Limit

Think of water. At the microscopic level, it's a chaotic collection of molecules bouncing around. But at macroscopic scales, it flows smoothly. The Navier-Stokes equations describe this flow without reference to individual molecules.

Spacetime is similar. At the Planck scale, it may be a quantum mess. But at macroscopic scales, the "molecules" average out. What remains is the smooth geometry of general relativity.

This is a hydrodynamic limit. The screen has an enormous number of degrees of freedom. Their collective behavior is captured by a smooth metric.

### Error Suppression

Corrections to general relativity scale as:

$$\left(\frac{\ell_P}{L}\right)^2$$

where L is the scale of interest and the Planck length is:

$$\ell_P = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar G}{c^3}} \approx 10^{-35} \text{ m}$$

For any macroscopic process, this ratio is absurdly tiny. General relativity is exact for all practical purposes.

### The Best Compression

Emergent geometry is the most economical description of how modular clocks fit together.

Imagine collecting all the data about how every patch's modular flow relates to every other patch's flow. This is an enormous amount of information.

But there's a compression. If you specify a metric g_{ab}, you can derive all the modular flows from it. The metric is the minimum description that captures the overlap structure.

General relativity is the unique dynamics consistent with this compression. It's not arbitrary. It's the simplest theory that respects the structure.

## 15.11 What the Framework Resolves

These "open questions" in conventional physics have natural answers in our model.

### The Planck Scale: Not a Mystery

In standard physics, people ask: "What happens at the Planck scale? Does spacetime break down?"

Our model dissolves this question. The holographic screen with its algebra net at UV scale ℓ_UV is the fundamental description. Spacetime geometry doesn't "break down" at small scales because spacetime was never fundamental. It emerges from the screen.

The Planck scale marks where the emergent geometric description becomes unreliable. Below this scale, you must use the screen description directly. There's no mysterious "quantum foam" or "spacetime fluctuations." There's just the algebra net, which is perfectly well-defined.

This is like asking "what happens to temperature below one molecule?" The question is malformed. Temperature is emergent. Below a certain scale, you switch to the microscopic description. The same applies to geometry.

### The Cosmological Constant: Not a Problem

The "cosmological constant problem" assumes quantum field theory is fundamental. QFT predicts vacuum energy 10^120 times larger than observed. Something must cancel it.

In our model, QFT is not fundamental. It's an effective description that emerges from the screen. The cosmological constant Lambda is fixed by the reference curvature built into the screen structure. The Gibbons-Hawking entropy S = A/(4G) sets the scale.

The "problem" exists only if you compute vacuum energy using QFT and assume that calculation is fundamental. We don't. The screen determines Lambda directly through the entanglement equilibrium condition. QFT vacuum fluctuations are emergent phenomena, not fundamental contributions to the stress tensor.

The observed small value of Lambda isn't a fine-tuning miracle. It's simply what the screen structure produces. (Why the screen has this particular structure remains open, but that's a different question from the traditional "cancellation problem.")

### Black Hole Information: Resolved by Construction

In our model, information is always on the screen. That's where the fundamental data lives. The bulk, including black hole interiors, is emergent.

When matter falls into a black hole, its information was always on the horizon screen. It gets scrambled, redistributed across screen degrees of freedom. When the black hole evaporates, the information comes out in the Hawking radiation because it never left the screen.

There's no "information paradox" because the paradox assumes information can be in the bulk independently of the screen. In our model, this assumption is false. The bulk is a compressed description of screen data. Information can't be "lost" in the bulk because the bulk isn't where information fundamentally lives.

The detailed dynamics of how information gets scrambled and unscrambled on the screen is complex. But there's no paradox, no violation of unitarity. The screen evolution is unitary by construction.

## 15.12 What Remains Open

The model answers many traditional puzzles but raises its own questions:

### The Specific Screen Structure

Why does the screen have the particular structure it does? Why these constraints, these symmetries? The model derives physics from the screen, but doesn't yet explain why the screen is what it is.

### The UV Completion

The regulator premises R0 and R1 describe the UV structure abstractly. A concrete microscopic model realizing these premises is still missing. What are the fundamental degrees of freedom on the screen?

### The Constraint Set

MaxEnt selection requires a constraint set. Where does this constraint set come from? Why these constraints and not others?

These are genuine open questions. But they're different from the traditional puzzles. We're no longer asking "how do we reconcile QFT with gravity?" We're asking "why does the screen have this structure?" That's progress.

## 15.13 Reverse Engineering Summary

| Intuitive Picture | Surprising Hint | First-Principles Reframing |
|---|---|---|
| Time is universal | Light speed is constant | Time is a coordinate in 4D geometry |
| Gravity is a force | Free fall is indistinguishable from inertia | Gravity is spacetime curvature |
| Geometry is fixed | Modular flow is the clock | Spacetime emerges from compatible modular clocks |

**What falls directly from patch consistency:**

- No preferred reference frame (no privileged observer exists)
- Lorentz kinematics (Conf(S²) ≅ SO(3,1))
- The tensor character of Einstein's equation (all observers must agree)

Einstein discovered special relativity by thinking about light and motion. We can understand it differently: Lorentz symmetry is the geometry of how modular times mesh across patches. This follows directly from the absence of a privileged "third-party" frame.

**What requires additional assumptions:**

- The scalar Einstein equation in each frame (requires MaxEnt + EFT bridge)
- The specific form of the stress tensor (requires UV completion)

Einstein discovered general relativity by thinking about falling elevators. We can connect this to our framework: Einstein's equation emerges when entanglement entropy is stationary. But this stationarity comes from MaxEnt selection, not from patch consistency alone. Jacobson showed this connection in 1995; our framework provides a reason *why* entropy should be stationary (MaxEnt) and uses patch consistency to promote the result to a tensor equation.

**The honest picture:**

The speed of light isn't a random constant. It's the conversion factor between information flow on the screen and emergent geometry in the bulk. This follows from patch consistency.

Gravity emerges from entanglement equilibrium. The equilibrium condition comes from MaxEnt; the tensor character comes from patch consistency; the connection to stress-energy requires an EFT bridge we haven't fully derived.

Newton's absolute time and space were beautiful ideas that served humanity well for two centuries. But they were always approximations. The deeper truth is that time and space are not the stage on which physics happens. They emerge from the physics itself.

We now have the stage: emergent spacetime with Lorentz kinematics and Einstein dynamics. We've seen how both spacetime (this chapter) and particles (Chapter 14) emerge from the screen. But what exactly IS matter in this model? How do the classical concepts of particles, energy, and motion relate to the deeper quantum structure?

That's the question of **Chapter 16: Matter, Motion, and Classical Physics**.
