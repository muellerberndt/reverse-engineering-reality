# Prologue: Physicists Are Hackers

## The Cosmic Program

Reverse engineering a program without source code is an exercise in inference.

You run it. You feed it inputs and watch what comes out. You monitor its
behavior-API calls, network traffic, memory access patterns, timing. You poke
it, stress it, run it in different environments. Gradually, from thousands of
observations, you build a mental model of what it's doing and why.

You never see the code. You only see behavior. Your job is to work backward
from effects to causes, from outputs to algorithms, from symptoms to structure.

Physics is the same discipline, applied to reality itself.

Except reality doesn't even give us bytecode to disassemble. There's no hex
dump to stare at, no instruction pointer to trace. We have only behavior:
things fall, light bends, particles interact, time passes. Our instruments
are our monitoring tools. Our experiments are our test inputs. And from the
outputs-meter readings, detector clicks, interference patterns-we try to
reconstruct the underlying logic.

This is reverse engineering at its most extreme. The "program" we're analyzing
is the universe. It's been running for 13.8 billion years. We've been
seriously probing it for maybe four centuries. And the complexity is beyond
anything human engineers have ever built.

Thousands of the smartest humans who ever lived have contributed to this
project. Newton, Maxwell, Einstein, Bohr, Heisenberg, Feynman, Hawking-each
generation inheriting the partial models of the previous one, refining them,
finding the gaps, and pushing deeper. We're still at it. The current best
model-quantum field theory plus general relativity-predicts behavior with
stunning accuracy but remains incomplete, inconsistent at the edges, and
deeply mysterious at its core.

## The Weirdest Program Ever Written

Here's what makes physics the ultimate reverse engineering challenge: the
program we're analyzing behaves in ways that violate every intuition we
brought to the task.

**There's no preferred reference frame.** Run your experiments on a moving
train or a stationary platform-the laws work identically. There's no "true"
rest frame hidden somewhere. Every observer's perspective is equally valid.

**Time dilates.** Clocks in motion run slow relative to stationary ones. Not
because they're broken-because time itself is relative. Your five minutes
and my five minutes aren't the same five minutes if we're moving differently.

**Measurement affects outcomes.** Try to precisely determine a particle's
position and momentum simultaneously-you can't. The act of measurement
changes the system. Properties don't exist independently of observation.

**Entangled particles stay correlated.** Create two particles in a special
state, separate them by light-years, measure one-and the other instantly
reflects a correlated result. No signal passes between them. The correlation
is just... there.

**Information can't be destroyed.** Throw something into a black hole, and
the information doesn't disappear. It's encoded on the horizon, scrambled
but technically recoverable. The universe keeps perfect logs.

**Space might be a hologram.** The information needed to describe a volume
of space can be encoded entirely on its boundary. The three-dimensional
world may be a projection from two-dimensional data.

If a human engineer wrote a program with these specifications, we'd assume
they were trolling us. But this is how reality behaves. These aren't bugs.
They're features. And the fact that they seem contradictory or impossible
is our problem, not nature's.

## The Question We Rarely Ask

For centuries, physicists have catalogued these anomalies and built
mathematical models to predict them. Quantum mechanics works. Relativity
works. The standard model works. The predictions match observations to
absurd precision.

But there's a question we rarely stop to ask:

**Why do we assume an objective reality exists at all?**

Think about it. What do we actually have access to? Subjective experiences.
Sensations, perceptions, measurements, memories. We see, hear, feel, detect.
We compare notes with other observers and find that we generally
agree. The apple is red. The electron went left. The clock shows 3 PM.

This agreement is striking. It demands explanation. But does it require
an "objective" world existing independently of all observers?

We've assumed yes for so long that the question sounds strange. Of course
there's an objective reality-what else could there be? But look closer.
Every piece of evidence we have for objective reality is itself a subjective
experience. Every measurement, every observation, every data point passes
through an observer. We never step outside our perspectives to check if
there's something "really there" independent of all observation.

What if subjective experiences are all there is? What if "objective reality"
is just a matter of consensus-the structure that emerges when observers
compare notes and find they agree?

## The Shift

This book explores a conceptual shift: **subjective realities are all there
is.**

This does not mean solipsism, or that "anything goes," or that "reality is
whatever you want it to be." Consistency across perspectives
creates the appearance of objectivity. The stable, shared, predictable
structure that we call "the physical world" is the overlap-consistent
backbone that all observers must agree on.

This is a significant shift from the traditional view. We don't claim
it's proven-much of what follows is speculative, working toward a model
rather than declaring one complete. But consider what happens when you
work out the consequences.

Once you make this shift, strange features of reality start making sense.
The "weird" behaviors of physics-the ones that seem bizarre or paradoxical
from the objective-reality viewpoint-start looking natural. Expected, even.
Not anomalies to explain away, but structural necessities of a universe built
on observer consistency.

Why is there no preferred reference frame? Because there's no privileged
observer to define one. Why does measurement affect outcomes? Because "measurement"
is just observer patches comparing notes. Why does time dilate? Because different
observers have different internal clocks, and relativity is the consistency
condition between them. Why can't you explain consciousness from physics?
Because you're trying to derive the inside from the outside-but there is no
outside.

Long-standing philosophical puzzles dissolve too. The hard problem of
consciousness, the measurement problem in quantum mechanics, the nature of
time, the question of free will-these stop being mysteries and start looking
like artifacts of asking the wrong question. We were trying to explain how
observers emerge from an objective world. But if there is no objective world
independent of observers, the question was malformed from the start.

The math we've developed over centuries doesn't change. Quantum mechanics
still works. Relativity still works. But the interpretation shifts. Instead
of describing an objective world that somehow produces observers, we're
describing the consistency conditions that observers must satisfy to share
a reality.

## What This Book Does

This book reverse engineers reality from first principles.

We start with a minimal assumption: observers exist, they have bounded
access to information, and they must agree where their observations overlap.

If the model is correct, this framework has exactly one free parameter: the pixel area, the geometric size of a single computational element on the holographic screen. Everything else (Newton's constant, gauge couplings, particle masses, the structure of spacetime) either follows from the axioms or is determined by ratios involving this single scale.

From this starting point, we derive constraints. We show how the mathematical
structures of quantum mechanics and relativity emerge from consistency
requirements. We trace the logic from axioms to consequences, carefully
distinguishing between what is rigorously established, what is conditionally
derived, and what remains speculative.

We are not claiming to have solved physics. We're proposing a model-a
way of organizing the strange behaviors we've discovered-and showing that
many apparent mysteries dissolve once you make the conceptual shift from
"objective reality exists" to "consistency across observers is fundamental."

The structure follows the logic of reverse engineering:

1. **Observe anomalies.** Each chapter starts with the "intuitive picture"
   most people hold, then introduces the "surprising hint"-the discovery
   that broke that intuition.

2. **Reverse engineer principles.** We show how the anomaly makes sense once
   you adopt the observer-consistency model.

3. **Test against behavior.** We catalogue predictions, both verified and
   testable. We note what would falsify the model.

Some parts of this model rest on established mathematics and physics.
Some parts are conditional-they follow if certain assumptions hold. Some
parts are genuinely speculative, marked as such. Our goal is not to convince
you everything is settled, but to show you a coherent way of thinking about
the strangeness and invite you to probe it.

## Let's Go

Reality is the strangest program ever written. It's been running since the
Big Bang, processing inputs and producing outputs according to rules we're
still decoding. Thousands of brilliant minds have contributed to the reverse
engineering effort, and we've made extraordinary progress.

But the naive model-a 3D world of independent objects moving through absolute
time, existing whether or not anyone observes it-turns out to be the
equivalent of a stub loader. It works for everyday purposes, but it's not
what's really going on.

What's really going on might be weirder, more elegant, and more unified than
the surface suggests. It might start not with objects, but with observers.
Not with a world, but with perspectives that must agree.

Let's find out.
